Automatic Upgrade Helper
========================

This is a utility designed to be used in conjunction with the
OpenEmbedded build system (BitBake and OE-Core) in order to
automatically generate upgrades for recipes based on new versions being
published upstream.


Setup
-----

1. Ensure you have a working copy of the build system that is configured
   and ready to run, i.e. you've run the oe-init-build-env script to
   create a build directory and edited local.conf / bblayers.conf as
   desired.

2. Prepare a configuration file, by default in $BUILDDIR/upgrade-helper,
   as below:

--------------- snip ---------------
[maintainer_override]
# mails for recipe upgrades will go to john.doe instead of jane.doe, etc
jane.doe@doe.com=john.doe@doe.com
johhny.bravo@bravo.com=john.doe@doe.com

[settings]
# recipes in blacklist will be skipped
blacklist=python glibc gcc
# only recipes belonging to maintainers in whitelist will be attempted
maintainers_whitelist=jane.doe@doe.com john.doe@doe.com johhny.bravo@bravo.com
# SMTP server
smtp=smtp.my-server.com:25
# from whom should the mails arrive
from=upgrade.helper@my-server.com
# who should get the status mail with statistics, at the end
status_recipients=john.doe@doe.com
# clean sstate directory before upgrading
clean_sstate=yes
# clean tmp directory before upgrading
clean_tmp=yes
# keep previous commits or not
drop_previous_commits=yes
# machines to test build with
machines=qemux86 qemux86-64 qemuarm qemumips qemuppc
--------------- snip ---------------

3. Enable distrodata and supply appropriate additional metadata. For
   example, you could add the following to your conf/local.conf:

--------------- snip ---------------
INHERIT =+ "distrodata"
require conf/distro/include/recipe_color.inc
require conf/distro/include/distro_alias.inc
require conf/distro/include/maintainers.inc
require conf/distro/include/upstream_tracking.inc
--------------- snip ---------------

WARNING: if you are using the default maintainers.inc file supplied
         with Poky (in meta-yocto) and you don't set a
         maintainers_whitelist or maintainer_override in the
         upgrade-helper configuration as above, and you specify "all"
         on the command line, the script will automatically send out
         emails to the default maintainers. Please be careful not to
         do this :)

4. Enable buildhistory by adding the following lines to your
conf/local.conf file:

--------------- snip ---------------
INHERIT =+ "buildhistory"
BUILDHISTORY_COMMIT" = "1"
--------------- snip ---------------

(Do not remove any other inherited class in the process, e.g. distrodata).


Usage
-----

Some manual usage examples:

* To upgrade the xmodmap recipe to the latest available version,
  interactively:
    $ upgrade-helper.py xmodmap

* To upgrade the xmodmap recipe to a user specified version,
  interactively:
    $ upgrade-helper.py xmodmap -t 1.2.3

* To upgrade a list of recipes in automatic mode:
    $ upgrade-helper.py -a xmodmap xf86-video-intel

* To attempt to upgrade all recipes and automatically send email
  messages to maintainers for each attempted recipe as well as a
  status mail at the end, use:
    $ upgrade-helper.py all

If you wish to run the script on a regular basis, you can set up a cron
job; the "weeklyjob.sh" file distributed with this project is the basis
of a script you can call from a cron job and also provides an example
crontab line.
